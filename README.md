STAT 1261 Final Paper

In this project, we used a multiple linear regression model to explore the relationship between various explanatory variables and the response variable of annual salary in the data science field. The initial model used all variables in the dataset to analyze the relationship, while the final model prioritized using certain variables that provided a more effective analysis. Using a linear regression model allows us to explore the data and eventually make predictions about salary. The distribution of annual salaries itself was heavily right-skewed, which was important to consider when analyzing the relationship with other variables. While this model gives us a great insight into what impacts a data scientistâ€™s annual salary, there are some factors not considered that could be helpful for future research.
